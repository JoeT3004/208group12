# This is the code for the static classifier 
# this is within a seperate program due to the fact that the simulator on a Mac has no connection to the webcam
# so a seperate python program is used to see the webcam due to technological restrictions. The python program 
# then uses sockets to communicate with the swift program. 

# This program uses Mediapipe gesture recogniser framework for classifying static poses as alphabet charicters
