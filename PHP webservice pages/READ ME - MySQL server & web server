GUIDE FOR CONNECTING TO SQL SERVER ON LINUX FARM (SSH):

1. Connect to university linux farm with 'ssh -m hmac-sha2-512 sgtbrett@lxfarm08.csc.liv.ac.uk' on command line
2. Log into MySQL workbench and make sure that the server is running on lxfarm08
3. Enter 'mysql -h studdb.csc.liv.ac.uk sgtbrett' on command line to connect to the database

PHP PAGES THAT ARE WORKING - 

Access by logging into the linux farm (as above), before accessing the phpwebservice folder with 'cd public_html/phpwebservice' - then just nano whichever file you need to edit.
Where there is a symbol like <USERNAME>, replace with a variable as entered by the user. (or for testing purposes just add your own testing arguments)
