PHP PAGES THAT ARE WORKING - 

Access by logging into the linux farm (as above), before accessing the phpwebservice folder with 'cd public_html/phpwebservice' - then just nano whichever file you need to edit.
Where there is a symbol like <USERNAME>, replace with a variable as entered by the user. (or for testing purposes just add your own testing arguments)
