READ ME - how to build Xcode project from clone repo & push it after changes.  What Ive had to work out to get the framework working  Build Xcode project from cloned repo

A file in the project uses git lfs, this is a large file that requires the framework to work. This file is too large for GitHub to push to (Over 100mb) as such git ifs is required. This means every time you clone the repo you have to pull the git lfs original files.  Do this in terminal.

Navigate to projects directory using ‘cd’.

Install git lfs if not already:  

Terminal commands
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install git-lfs

Follow the steps below that the terminal gives you after the /bin/... line.
Next steps (may be different depending on the device I am not sure) :
- Run these two commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH:
    (echo; echo 'eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> /Users/JT/.zprofile
    eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"
- Run brew help to get started
- Further documentation:
    https://docs.brew.sh

brew install git-lfs

Terminal commands after git lfs install:
git lfs install
git lfs pull   

Xcode should now be able to be built on phone.
Next steps are for when you want to push to the repo not clone.
Push it after changes Terminal commands:

git add -A
git commit -m "Your meaningful commit message here" 

Make sure git lfs supports tracking for files with .a 
Terminal commands:  
git lfs track "*.a"  
git lfs push --all origin main  
git push origin main --force
